## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm DogWaterDev, a pretty bad programmer from Germany.
## I play a lot of games, and am open to collaboration. If you want to reach me, send me a message on discord at PotatonianDrakonian1337#2674
## ðŸ”­ Learning C and maybe game engine (again ikr, i took a extended break from the one in java), a compiler for my programming language, and a few school projects.
# Reach me on discord at PotatonianDrakonian1337 or join my Discord server here: https://discord.gg/zbhvruNCnG
## Collaboration is open for DGE and JLI-C, as well as DurianCompiler (check readmes and descriptions for what they are)
## Would also greatly appreciate some aid with my projects in C (my first non-oo language)

### psst play xp-craft.mcplay.fun on minecraft
