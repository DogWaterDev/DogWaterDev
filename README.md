## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm DogWaterDev, a pretty bad programmer from Germany. I'm currently working on learning Python and hope to learn a compiled OOP language, too!
## I play a lot of games, and am open to collaboration. If you want to reach me, send me a message on discord at PotatonianDrakonian1337#2674
